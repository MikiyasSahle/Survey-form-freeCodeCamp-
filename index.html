        <li><span class="bold-first-word">1960 - </span>Abebe  Abebe purchased new running shoes, but they did not fit well and gave him blisters.He consequently decided to run barefoot instead.Abebe's winning time was 2:15:16.2, twenty-five seconds faster than ben Abdesselam at 2:15:41.6 and breaking Popov's world record by eight tenths of a second.Immediately after crossing the finish line Abebe began to touch his toes and run in place,and later said that he could have run another 10–15 km (6–9 mi)</li>
        <li><span class="bold-first-word">1961 - </span>Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot.This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted.The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Košice.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>I was amazed by his feet. I knew later that he ran barefoot. The soles of his feet were as thick and black as coal. I remember that I wanted to touch his feet, the hard skin of which resembled the tyres of big military trucks. I was sure that he would feel nothing but, on the contrary, this hard skin was very sensitive: I hardly brushed it with my finger and he jumped up on the bed and gave me an astounded look</p>
